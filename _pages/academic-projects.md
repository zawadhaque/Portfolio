### **[Intel-A-Chat]**
**Description:** Intel-A-Chat was created with the goal of creating a common space for experts and laypersons alike to collaborate in their various fields of interest, ultimately fostering an open access and global environment for learning. This is where our area of focus within this project, Lascaux Llama, draws its namesake - from the Lascaux cave network in France, which is home to some of the earliest known human paintings and is thought to be one of the earliest communal hubs of knowledge in the history of our species. Lascaux Llama serves this goal by creating a neural network of NOVAs - Noun Object Verb Associations - that allow its users to explore various related subjects and ideas as well as providing guidance in this exploration through a series of interviews that helps tailor the experience to the needs of each individual user. Our work on this project has consisted of expanding the interactive functionality of the NOVAs within the main functionality of Lascaux Llama; to provide visualization for these abstract concepts and to provide expert validation and guidance in this new and interactive learning experience.
