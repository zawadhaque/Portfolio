I am **Zawad Haque**, a Cybersecurity student at the University of Michigan. Most of my interests lie in defensive security. I have done many academic and technical projects that explore security controls, defense mechanisms, incident response, and digital forensics investigations.
This portfolio in particular showcases these academic and technical projects, certifications, and experience.
